# Stackover flow data in year 2017.

### Based on the ( CRISP - DM ) Rules , we will make data analysis for Stackover Flow web site on 2017

# Requirements to run this tutorial
**To follow this tutorial you need to have the following packages installed:**

- Python version  3.
- pandas latest version  http://pandas.pydata.org/ 
- numpy latest version http://www.numpy.org/
- matplotlib latest version http://matplotlib.org/
- seaborn https://seaborn.pydata.org/

**The Machine Learning Algoritthms used is scikit-learn  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/.**


# download the data file at Repository link https://github.com/apomohab/udacity_datascience_first_project

# The  steps Data analysis.

**this project follwoed the ( CRISP - DM ) Rules**

### Step 1 - 2 : Business understand & Data understand

**in this step we need to get answers for some questions from data like examples**

**1- how many the programmers contribute to open source projects in united state ?**

**2- how many the gender of male have the Computer science or software engineering degree ?**

**3- how many the ProgramHobby and what about the dataframe ?**


# step 3  : Prepare Data  

 - in this step we will working around data and make cleaning data 
 - in this step we need to know some info same 
 - **what is percent missing values in the varibles**
 - **what is varibles have more missing values** 
 - **what is frequent values in the varibles**
 - **what is the best decesion for missing values**
 - **Assign the predicts varibles and Response varibles**
 
 
 ### Step 4 :  Data Modeling
- in this step we will work in machine learning step


### Step 5 : Evaluate Results
- in this step we will used Algorithms Accuracy Results model
- and we will used here. 
- in this step we will used Algorithms Accuracy Results modelthe algorithms
- Mean Squared error https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/machine-learning-mean-squared-error-regression-line-c7dde9a26b93/
- R2 Squared error https://vitalflux.com/mean-square-error-r-squared-which-one-to-use/


# The Results predict model in this project is 
- The mean squared score for the model using only quantitative variables was 1.0002248107407395e+29 on 15418 values.
- The r-squared score for the model using only quantitative variables was -2.48560182584156e+20 on 15418 values.
